# docs

A central repository that hosts the configuration and build settings for documentation across all repos in the Vrui organization.

The docs are built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the [Material for MkDocs theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

## How it works

Documentation for each repo is hosted in the `docs/` directory of that repo. This repository aggregates and builds the documentation from all repos in the Vrui organization.

### Updating the docs site

When the `docs/` directory is updated in any repo (e.g. `vrui-vr/arsandbox`), the `docs-update.yml` GitHub Action is triggered, which tells the `docs` repo (this one) to pull in the latest changes and rebuild the documentation site.

The most up-to-date version of `docs-update.yml` is located in this repository under `templates/workflows/docs-update.yml`.

### Site config

The main configuration for the documentation site is in `mkdocs.base.yml`. This file specifies the site name, navigation menu, theme, plugins, and other settings.

This is important because it ensures a consistent look/feel across all documentation and access to plugins, regardless of which repo the docs come from.

### Merging `nav.yml` files

While the base navigation structure is defined in `mkdocs.base.yml`, each repo can define its own navigation structure by adding a `nav.yml` file in its `docs/` directory.

The `nav.yml` files from each repo are merged into (`mkdocs.generated.yml`) which is used to build the documentation site. The merging is done in the order that the repos are listed in `repos.txt`.

The base navigation structure is defined in `mkdocs.base.yml`, which includes the home page and other common pages. The `mkdocs.yml` file then includes this base navigation and the generated navigation.

1. First, the `build-and-deploy-docs.yml` GitHub Action in this repository pulls in the latest changes under `<repo>/docs/`from all repos listed in `repos.txt`.
2. Then, it runs the `scripts/generate-mkdocs.py` script to merge the `nav.yml` files from each repo into a single `mkdocs.generated.yml` file.

### Behind the scenes

In order to make all the repos play nice with each other, the `docs-update.yml` workflow in each repo references a common `DOCS_DEPLOY_TOKEN` secret, which is a GitHub personal access token with `repo` and `workflow` scopes.

This token is an organization-level secret, so it can be used by any repo in the Vrui organization. That way, no individual repo needs to have its own token, which would be a pain to manage.

Most of the existing repositories in the Vrui organization already have access to this secret. However, if you are creating a new repo and want to add documentation for it, you will need to give that repo access to the `DOCS_DEPLOY_TOKEN` secret by going to Vrui's Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > Organization secrets, and then clicking "Edit DOCS_DEPLOY_TOKEN" (the pencil icon). Once there, click the gear icon and add the new repository to the list of selected repositories that can access the secret.

Important!!! The `DOCS_DEPLOY_TOKEN` secret value is based on a personal access token (PAT) that is owned by a specific user (currently me: @nredick). It is set to never expire, but if that user leaves the organization, the token will need to be regenerated and updated in the organization secrets to someone else with permissions to make changes to the repos. In short, the PAT behind the `DOCS_DEPLOY_TOKEN` secret allows the repos to act on the user's behalf to tell `vrui-vr/docs` that it's time to rebuild (which requires a certain level of permissions).

What this looks like:

A new build and deploy job is triggered, and appears to be "manually" run by the user who owns the PAT (currently me: @nredick).

## Getting started: adding documentation for a new repo

1. Ensure the new repo has a `docs/` directory with an `index.md` file.
2. Copy `templates/workflows/docs-update.yml` to `.github/workflows/docs-update.yml` in the repo that you are creating docs in. See [`vrui-vr/arsandbox/docs/nav.yml`](https://github.com/vrui-vr/arsandbox/blob/main/docs/nav.yml) for an example of how to structure the `nav.yml` file. Recommended: check out `mkdocs.generated.yml` in *this* repository to see how the `nav.yml` files are merged.
3. Create the `nav.yml` file in the `docs/` directory of the new repo, following the format of existing `nav.yml` files. (Do not rename it to something else, as the script expects it to be named `nav.yml`.)
4. Add the new repo to the `repos` list in `repos.text` in *this* repository.
5. Create a change in the main branch of the repo that you are adding docs for, which will trigger the `docs-update.yml` workflow and update the docs site.
6. Check out the changes at https://vrui-vr.github.io/docs/ after a the build-and-deploy job has completed (a few minutes).

## Testing changes locally

You can (AND SHOULD) test any changes to the documentation site locally by following these steps:

1. Clone this repository (and the repository you are creating docs for) to your local machine.
2. Ensure that they are located in the same parent directory, e.g.:

   ```sh
   ~/src/docs
   ~/src/arsandbox
   ```

3. Make sure you have the correct dependencies installed. If you use conda, you can create and activate the environment with:

   ```sh
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate vrui
   ```

4. Run `./scripts/local-build-and-serve.sh` from the root of *this* repository. This will create symbolic links to the `docs/` directories of all repos listed in `repos.txt` if you have a local version of that repo, then it will generate the merged `mkdocs.generated.yml` file, and then start a local MkDocs server. When finished, it will clean up the symbolic links.
