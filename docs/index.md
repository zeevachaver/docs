# Vrui Overview

Vrui is both a collection of software and a community of XR developers and scientific investigators and educators who use XR for research and teaching.

The Vrui Toolkit is a comprehensive development framework designed to facilitate the creation of immersive virtual reality applications. It provides a suite of tools and libraries that enable developers to build VR software with advanced 3D user interfaces, supporting a wide range of input devices and display systems. Vrui emphasizes flexibility and scalability, making it suitable for applications in scientific visualization, data exploration, and other fields requiring interactive 3D environments.

Vrui Applications are applications developed using the Developer Toolkit and deployed as part of Vrui installation to provide specific XR experiences. For example, the LIDAR Viewer is an interactive application for processing, visualization, and analysis of large 3D point cloud data produced by terrestrial or airborne LiDAR scanning. Links to the repositories of Vrui applications that are released as Open Source Software (OSS) and whose developer(s) commit to upholding the Vrui Code of Conduct appear in Vrui Organizations lit of repositories on this page.

The Vrui Community is the entire community of Vrui users and developers. (As of March, 2025, we are aware of approximately 2,000 Vrui users). Please see our Code of Conduct for detailed information about Vrui values and standards.
